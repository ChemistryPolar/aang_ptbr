## AANG is the AVATAR AUTOMATED NUMBER GENERATOR - a Discord Dice Bot for the new Avatar Legends roleplaying game from Magpie Games

AANG is based on [maddie](https://github.com/harkano/maddie) (for Masks: The New Generation, also by Magpie Games)

Right now he's very bare bones - 

* type /move to use the basic moves
* type /fight to choose and roll one of the 3 basic fighting types
* type /balance to use any of the balance moves

AANG will prompt you for any modifier as optional commands for now.

More to come including character, labels, conditions, balance and growth management!

Go wild and let us know in [discord](https://discord.gg/uCFZNBxVCC) if you have any issues, or submit issues here in the git
